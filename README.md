# Impact-of-Covid-on-Airlines-Industry
Businesses across industries all over the world are facing crisis due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and airlines industries also facing the same fate due to the pandemic.There is some improvement in last few months but how much is the impact and what time it will take to come into the previous situation, to analyze this i will use the last 10 years passenger, revenue, load and other datas, and will see there trend and behavior, for this i will use some time series plot to analyze the trend, seasonality and level of the values and in the end i will predict for the next 2 years data by using different methods like ARIMA, Additive Seasonality, Exponential Seasonality etc.
